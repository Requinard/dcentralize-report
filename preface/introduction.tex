\chapter{Introduction}
This document is the lving and breathing report of my internship at d-centralize, a software engineering firm. During my time here I have worked on the AppSemble project, a way for non-technical people to make their own apps. \\

I'd like to thank Kees van den Broek and the coworkers at d-centralize for the guidance they provided when I needed it. \\

I also want to thank Rene van der Heijden and Marieke van Vught for their support from the Fontys side, making sure I could always proceed at my breakneck pace, while still writing the documentation needed.
